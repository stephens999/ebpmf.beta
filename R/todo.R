# Keep track of possible to-dos
# - test more thoroughly, particularly with column-specific tau
# - try updating tau only using non-zero elements?
# - try centering M-B before applying flash? or updating the first factor
# every iteration?
# - try keeping track of second moments in flash? (need flash_update_data to help this)
# - is the current updating a factor (backfitting) in update_r1 legitimate?
